    "## So what is Git (revision control) \n",

    "__What the website says__ : _Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency_\n",
    "\n",
    "__What the creator says__ : _Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals._\n",
    "\n",
    "__What this really means to you__ : _Git allows you to manage edits to code/documents from multiple different people on different platforms whilst maintaining a full and complete version history and log_\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form revision control is any system that allows a history of changes to be recorded and normally will provide a mechanism to go back in time to a specified time/commit.  This can be very useful for code but can also be used on basically any text document such as markdown or LaTeX.  Not only does it allow you to keep a record of your work but if you decide you prefer the way your chapter was written before it is a simple command to return the text to that form.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working in a group revision cotrol is pretty much required. This is becase it will deal with things such as one contributor replacing anothers work by accident and it will highlightto you when to contributors have edited the same section, allowing you to merge and create the best of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "So its quite easy to see the potential benefits of using revision control, in the specific case Git, to manage code and text documents. Both when working as a group or individually."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For this course you all have access to a virtual machine (you're on it now) that has git installed and ready to use. You can test this by executing the cell beneath by clicking on it the pressing shift+enter on your keyboard."
